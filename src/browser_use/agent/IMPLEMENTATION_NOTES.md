# Implementation Notes for TypeScript Port

## Current Status

The TypeScript port of the browser-use Agent class is partially completed. The main functionalities that have been implemented include:

1. Basic agent structure with proper constructor and property types
2. LLM response handling with three modes:
   - Function calling for OpenAI-style models
   - Raw text parsing for text-based LLM responses
   - Standard response parsing for structured outputs
3. Callback handling for step registration and completion notification
4. Multi-action execution with proper error handling
5. Browser state handling with screenshot capture and DOM element selection
6. Implementation of the "force done action" feature for last steps

## Known Issues

Several TypeScript linter errors remain due to incomplete integration between modules:

1. **Type Mismatches**: Type definitions for `ActionResult` and `BrowserState` in the agent module versus browser module are incompatible, especially around properties like `include_in_memory`.

2. **Missing Browser Methods**: The Browser class needs implementation of methods like:
   - `getBrowserInstance()` - To access the underlying Playwright browser
   - `getCurrentPage()` - To get the current active page

3. **Playwright Integration**: Current implementation assumes certain Playwright methods are available but doesn't properly integrate with the Playwright API:
   - `page.evaluate()` - For running JavaScript in page context
   - `browser.pages()` - For getting all open pages

## Next Steps

To complete the TypeScript port, the following steps are needed:

1. **Type Harmonization**: Create a shared type system for ActionResult and other interfaces to avoid type mismatches between modules.

2. **Browser Class Implementation**: Complete the Browser and BrowserContext classes to properly wrap Playwright functionality.

3. **Integration Testing**: Create integration tests for the Agent class to verify functionality.

4. **Memory Implementation**: Complete the Memory class port from Python to maintain chat history and context.

5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and examples.

## Type Implementation Strategy

The following approach is recommended to resolve type conflicts:

1. Create a central `types.ts` file in the root directory that defines core types used across modules.

2. Use TypeScript module augmentation to extend types where needed.

3. Use proper type guards to ensure type safety at runtime.

4. Consider using a more explicit dependency injection approach to improve testability.

## Browser Integration Strategy

For proper Playwright integration:

1. Create well-typed wrappers around Playwright functionality.

2. Use proper error handling for browser operations.

3. Implement connection management, page creation, and context handling.

4. Add proper cleanup and resource management.

## Documentation

Future documentation should include:

1. API reference for all classes and methods.

2. Usage examples for different LLM providers.

3. Configuration options and best practices.

4. Troubleshooting guidelines.

This port is a work in progress. The code structure is in place but needs further refinement to be fully functional.
