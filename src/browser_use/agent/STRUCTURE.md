# Agent Module Structure

The `browser-use-typescript` Agent module has been restructured to better match the Python project's organization pattern. The new structure separates concerns into distinct files:

## File Organization

- `index.ts`: Simple exports from the underlying implementation files
- `service.ts`: Contains the main `Agent` class implementation (equivalent to Python's `service.py`)
- `views.ts`: Contains data models, interfaces, and types (equivalent to Python's `views.py`)
- `prompts.ts`: Contains classes that generate prompts for different LLM interactions (equivalent to Python's `prompts.py`)
- `memory/`: Directory for memory-related functionality
  - `index.ts`: Memory implementation
  - `types.ts`: Memory types
- `message_manager/`: Directory for message management functionality
  - `index.ts`: MessageManager implementation
  - `types.ts`: MessageManager types
- `system_prompt.ts`: System prompt implementation

## Patterns

The code follows these patterns:

1. **Service/Views separation**: Business logic in service classes, data models in view classes
2. **Composition over inheritance**: Classes compose other classes rather than inheriting
3. **Type-safe interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces enforce contract between components
4. **Clean exports**: The index.ts file provides a clean public API

## Type Issues

The TypeScript version still has some type issues related to browser implementation details, particularly:

1. `Browser` type incompatibilities between the original implementation and the TypeScript port
2. Type casting is necessary in some places to work around these incompatibilities

## Completion Status

This refactoring provides the basic structure, but some implementation details were simplified or omitted. To fully implement the TypeScript port, the following would need to be completed:

1. Complete implementation of the `step()` method
2. Complete implementation of utility methods like `_getInteractedElements()`
3. Implement parsing functions for LLM responses
4. Complete error handling

## Python to TypeScript Mapping

| Python File | TypeScript File |
|-------------|----------------|
| service.py | service.ts |
| views.py | views.ts |
| prompts.py | prompts.ts |
| memory/service.py | memory/index.ts |
| memory/views.py | memory/types.ts |
| message_manager/service.py | message_manager/index.ts |
| message_manager/views.py | message_manager/types.ts |
| gif.py | (not implemented) |
